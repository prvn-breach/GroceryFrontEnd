# This is a helper script to run a command  on docker container from host machine
# Usage: ./dock container_name command_to_run param1 param2 param3

# This script assumes user has followed below conventions
#     1. User has home folder like /home/praveen
#     2. User has all web projects inside /home/praveen/www
#     3. User has mounted /home/praveen/www to /var/www on docker container

# User home directory is mapped to /var on docker container. Modify as required.
# Example: HOST:/home/praveen => CONTAINER:/var
# Any subfolders like www are mapped automatically
# Example: HOST:/home/praveen/www/restify => CONTAINER:/var/www/restify
MAP_HOST_DIR="${HOME}"
